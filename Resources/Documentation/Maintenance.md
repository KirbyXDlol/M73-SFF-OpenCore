# **Maintenance Status of this OpenCore configuration**

**Although I would love to keep this OpenCore configuration as up-to-date as possible, it can take a lot of effort and a lot of time. This means that this OpenCore configuration is not always completely up to date with the latest OpenCore version or kexts. Here is the current maintenance schedule of this OpenCore configuration.**

- New versions of the configuration will only come out every 3-4 OpenCore updates, or when a bug fix needs to be made.
- Once macOS kills support for Intel, this OpenCore configuration will likely be archived, and no further updates will be provided.
- The "legacy" branch is not maintained at all and does not get any updates.
- Support will be provided. Please feel free to make an issue if you have any problems with the configuration, and I will try to help you out to the best of my ability.
- Pull requests will be accepted, but it is possible that they may take a while to get merged into the main branch.
- Documentation changes may be made, but they will be fairly minor.

**Thanks for your understanding, and thanks for your support!**
